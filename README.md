- Untokenized dataset (contains instances that were filtered out in the SummScreen dataset and you need to recover the train/dev/test splits by matching the file names to the ones in the tokenized dataset): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tFpt32USOO2i1FWhtFTsyYyFzuRm2k36/view?usp=sharing

We note that the released codebase will be based on the tokenized dataset.
